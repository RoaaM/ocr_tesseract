Text,Summary
"Once upon a time, there was a young girl named Lily who lived in a small village nestled in a
lush forest. Lily was a curious and adventurous child, always seeking new experiences and
discoveries. One day, as she was wandering through the woods, she stumbled upon a
hidden pond.

The pond was unlike any she had ever seen before. Its waters were crystal clear and sparkled
in the sunlight. The banks were lined with vibrant wildflowers and ancient trees that seemed
to reach up to the sky. Lily felt a sense of wonder and awe wash over her, and she knew that

this was a special place.

As she gazed into the pond, Lily noticed a small fish swimming lazily in the water. The fish
was a brilliant shade of blue, and its scales shimmered in the light. Lily reached out to touch

the fish, but it darted away just out of her reach.

Determined to catch the fish, Lily spent hours sitting by the pond, trying to lure it with bits
of bread and insects. Eventually, the fish grew used to her presence and swam closer and

closer until Lily was finally able to scoop it up in her hands.

As she held the fish in her palms, Lily felt a sudden surge of energy flow through her body.
She could sense that this fish was no ordinary creature, but something magical and mystical.
With a sense of excitement and trepidation, Lily decided to take the fish home and care for

it.","

"Over the coming weeks and months, Lily grew closer to the fish, and they became the best
of friends. She would spend hours talking to the fish and telling it about her adventures in
the forest. In return, the fish would listen attentively and share its own tales of the

underwater world.

As time went on, Lily began to notice changes within herself. She felt more confident and
bold, and her sense of wonder and curiosity continued to grow. She knew that the fish had

given her a gift, one that she would cherish for the rest of her life.

Years passed, and Lily grew into a wise and kind woman. She continued to visit the pond and
the fish, and each time she did, she felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over her.
She knew that she had discovered something truly special, something that had changed her

life forever.","She continued to visit the pond and

"Don't Give Up

A long time ago, there was lived a boy named Rodney in a
village. He was very happy with his family. But his happiness
could not last for long. Rodney and his fellow villagers faced a
severe drought. They desperately waited for rains but with no
luck. All the crops, land and even trees dried up. The cattle
started dying. As there was no rain, the stream was drying up
slowly.

One night, during a meet with the villagers, Rodney said,
“Friends, we all have heard tales from our grandparents about
an underground river flowing through our village. Why don’t
we dig and see?” The villagers agreed and started digging.
They dug for some days but gave up soon. However, Rodney
kept on digging. When people told him to give up, he said,
“God is helping and guiding my way.”

One day, when he had dug deep enough, Rodney saw water.
His attitude of not giving up saved the whole village. “Never
give upso easily,” Rodney advised all the villagers. Now, they
are never short of water. And whenever any problem arises, all
the villagers came up together and find a solution.","

"The Ant
and
the Dove

One hot day, an ant was searching for some water.
After walking around for some time, she came to a
Spring. To reach the spring, she had to climb up a
blade of grass. While making her way up, she slipped
and fell into the water.

She could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree
had not seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble,
the dove quickly plucked off a leaf and dropped it into
the water near the struggling ant. The ant moved to-
wards the leaf and climbed up there. Soon it carried
her safely to dry ground. Just at that time, a hunter
nearby was throwing out his net towards the dove,
hoping to trap it.

Guessing what he was about to do, the ant quickly
bit him on the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter
dropped his net. The dove was quick to fly away to
safety.

One good turn deserves another.","The Ant

"Who is Happy?

Once a crow looked at a swan and thought how
beautiful the swan is. She had all white feathers
whereas the crow was black.

The crow expressed his thoughts to the swan. The
swan replied that according to her, the parrot is the
most beautiful bird as it has two colours and the
swan had just one.

Next, the crow approached the parrot, who simply
said that peacock is the most beautiful than him, as
it is multicolored.

When the crow expressed his thoughts to the
peacock, the peacock replied, “My dear crow, you
are the luckiest bird on this planet as you are never
caged” .“Because of my beauty, | am trapped in this
cage and you are free”.

On hearing this, the crow thought how foolish he
had been and thanked god for making him the way
he was.
Moral of the story:-
Never compare yourself to others. Be happy in what
you are and what you have.

"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the mountains, there lived a young girl _
named Mei. Mei was known throughout the village for her kind heart and her love of

adventure. She spent her days exploring the forests and meadows around her home, always
eager to discover something new.

One day, as she was wandering through the woods, Mei came across a beautiful butterfly. Its
wings were a bright shade of blue, and it fluttered about her head as if trying to get her

attention. Mei followed the butterfly deeper into the forest, until she came to a clearing that
she had never seen before.

In the center of the clearing stood a tall, majestic tree, its branches stretching up towards

the sky. And there, perched in the branches, was a tiny bird with feathers as golden as the
sun.

Mei felt a sudden surge of curiosity and wonder, and she climbed up the tree to get a closer

look. As she approached the bird, it chirped a sweet melody that filled her heart with joy.

“Hello, little one,"" Mei whispered. ""What brings you to this tree?""

The bird looked at Mei with its bright, beady eyes and sang a song that seemed to hold a

secret. Mei listened intently, trying to understand the meaning behind the melody.

As the sun began to set, Mei climbed down from the tree and made her way back to the

village. She couldn't stop thinking about the bird and its beautiful song,

and she knew that
she had to return to the tree the next day.","

For many days and nights, Mei visited the tree and listened to the bird's songs. She tried to

learn the words and the melody, but they were so complex that she could never quite grasp
them.

One day, as she was sitting beneath the tree, Mei had an idea. She pulled out a small
notebook and began to write down the notes and the lyrics to the bird's song. And as she

wrote, she found that the melody seemed to come alive on the page, filling her with a sense
of wonder and magic.

And so, Mei continued to visit the tree, writing down the bird's songs and filling her
notebook with the most beautiful melodies she had ever heard. And soon, the villagers

began to gather around her, eager to hear her play and sing the songs she had learned.

Mei had discovered a gift, and she shared it with the world, bringing joy and happiness to all
who heard her music. And she knew that she owed it all to the little bird with the golden
feathers, who had shown her the way to unlock the magic of music.","

"The Whale

There are between 79 and 84 different species of whale known to
man. They are found in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres
and never meet or breed together. Their migration is timed so
that they are never in breeding areas at the same time.

Whales are large, intelligent animals. They feed on small marine
life called krill.

The Blue Whale is the largest animal on Earth; it is larger than any
of the dinosaurs! A single adult Blue Whale can eat 36,000kg of
krill per day. They catch their food mainly by diving and can
descend to depths of approximately 500 meters (1640 feet). Its
heart is as big as a car, and its tongue can weigh as much as an
elephant.

THE STORY OF KING LEAR AND HIS THREE
DAUGHTERS.

(FROM SHAKESPEARE.)

LONG time ago, when the island of Great

Britain was not so large and prosperous a
country as now, but was a wild and thinly set-
tled island, divided into several kingdoms, there
reigned over one of these dominions an old mon-
arch called Lear. He was one of the mightiest
of the British kings, and though he had a kind
and generous heart, he was so passionate that
when one of his fits of rage possessed him, his
bravest and wisest counselors could not dissuade
him from any wild or frantic purpose which
seized him.

Lear had three children, all of them daughters,
and all very beautiful. The eldest was named
Goneril; the second, Regan; and the youngest,
Cordelia. Goneril and Regan were proud and
haughty beauties. They trod the halls of their
father’s palace as if they were already queens.

@ World War I (1914-1918), the Great War, was the worst the world had seen
(World War II would prove to be even worse), killing ten million troops.

@ The war was caused by the rivalry between European powers in the early
1900s. The assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in the Balkans, on
28 June, 1914, made Austria start a war with Serbia. Russia came to Serbia’s
defence. Germany declared war on Russia and her ally France on 3 August.

@ The Germans had a secret plan (the ‘Schlieffen plan’) for invading France.
Instead of tackling the French head-on, as expected, they swept round to
the north through neutral Belgium. This outrage drew Britain into the war.",Germany declared war on Russia and her ally France on 3 August.

The circus arrives without warning.
No announcements precede it, no paper notices

sky; countless tents of varying shapes and sizes, with
an elaborate wrought-iron fence encasing them in
a colorless world. Even what little ground is visible
from outside is black or white, painted or powdered,
or treated with some other circus trick.

drama which convulsed the calm but busy spot.

“Mother Etienne had given to a Cochin-China hen,

really wonderful to see these fifteen baby ducks, yellow as
canaries, beaks and webbed feet pink, swarming around the

come out presently and clamber helter-skelter onto her
broad back. As often happens with nurses, Yollande loved
the ducklings as her own children, and without worrying
about their shape or plumage, so different from her own, she
showered upon them proofs of the tenderest affection. Did a
fly pass within their reach, all these little ones jumped at it,","It was

"The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, which is
east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The dodo's closest genetic relative was the also-extinct Rodrigues
solitaire. The two formed the subfamily Raphinae, a clade of extinct flightless birds that were a part of the family
which includes pigeons and doves. The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon. A white dodo
was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of Réunion, but it is now believed that this assumption
was merely confusion based on the also-extinct Reunion ibis and paintings of white dodos.

Subfossil remains show the dodo was about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) tall and may have weighed 10.6—17.5 kg (23—
39 Ib) in the wild. The dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and written accounts
from the 17th century. Since these portraits vary considerably, and since only some of the illustrations are
known to have been drawn from live specimens, the dodos' exact appearance in life remains unresolved, and
little is known about its behaviour. It has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage, yellow feet, a tuft of tail
feathers, a grey, naked head, and a black, yellow, and green beak. It used gizzard stones to help digest its
food, which is thought to have included fruits, and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the
drier coastal areas of Mauritius. One account states its clutch consisted of a single egg. It is presumed that the
dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of
predators on Mauritius. Though the dodo has historically been portrayed as being fat and clumsy, it is now
thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem.

The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the following years, the bird was hunted
by sailors and invasive species, while its habitat was being destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting ofa
dodo was in 1662. Its extinction was not immediately noticed, and some considered it to be a myth. In the 19th
century, research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to
Europe in the early 17th century. Among these is a dried head, the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains
today. Since then, a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius, mostly from the Mare
aux Songes swamp. The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the

As Lily approached the tree, she noticed something odd. There was a small door at the base
of the trunk, just big enough for her to squeeze through. Without hesitation, she pushed

open the door and stepped inside.

To her surprise, she found herself in a magical room, filled with books and ancient artifacts.
There were maps and charts, crystal balls and potions, and all sorts of curious objects that
she had never seen before. As she wandered through the room, she came across a small

book, bound in leather and adorned with golden letters.

Curious, Lily picked up the book and began to read. As she did, she was transported to a far-
off land, filled with wonder and adventure. She met dragons and wizards, fairies and giants,

and traveled through deserts and mountains, forests and oceans.","

take many hours, so you would typically train a new system only every 24 hours or
‘even just weekly. If the amount of data is huge, it may even be impossible to use a batch
learning algorithm,
Finally, if your system needs to be able to learn autonomously and it has limited
Fesources (¢., a smartphone application or a rover on Mars), then carrying around
large amounts of training data and taking up a lot of resources to train
every day is a showstopper."

is a branch of Machine Learning that trains agents (such as bots) to pick the
actions that will maximize their rewards over time (e.g., a bot may get a reward
every time the player loses some life points), within a given environment (such as

the game). The famous AlphaGo program that beat the world champion at the
game of Go was built using RL.

This list could go on and on, but hopefully it gives you a sense of the incredible

breadth and complexity of the tasks that Machine Learning can tackle, and the types
of techniques that you would use for each task.

"No Free Lunch Theorem
A model is a simplified version of the observations. The simplifications are meant to
discard the superfluous details that are unlikely to generalize to new instances, To
decide what data to discard and what data to keep,

You must make assumptions. For
example, a linear model makes the assumption that the data is fu

indamentally linear
and that the distance between the instances and the straight line is just noise, which
can safely be ignored.

Jn famous 1996 paper. David Wolpert demonstrated that if you make absolutely
‘no assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any
‘other. This is called the No Free Lunch (NEL) theorem, For some datasets the best
‘model isa linear model, while for other

‘model thats a priori guaranteed to work

datasets it isa neural network. There is no

For example, for simple tasks you may evaluate
Hinear models with various levels of regularization, and for @ complex problem you
‘may evaluate various neural networks.

Learning In the next chapters we will dive deeper and write more code, but before we
‘do, make sure you know how to answer the following questions,

1. How would you define Machine Learning?”

"Pipelines
‘A sequence of data processing components is called a data pipeline. Pipelines are ver
common in Machine Learning systems, since there is a lot of data to manipulate and
‘many data transformations to apply,
‘Components typically run as
‘of data, processes it, and

synchronously. Each component pulls in a large amount

Tate, the next component inthe pipeline pulls this data and spits out its own output.

PPonent breaks down, the downstream components can often continue to run nor.
‘mally (atleast fr a while) by jst using the last output from the broken component.

‘This makes the architecture quite robust.

‘Om the other hand, a broken component can go unnoticed for some time if proper
