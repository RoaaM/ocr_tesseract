secret. Mei listened intently, trying to understand the meaning behind the melody.

As the sun began to set, Mei climbed down from the tree and made her way back to the

village. She couldn't stop thinking about the bird and its beautiful song, and she knew that
she had to return to the tree the next day.

For many days and nights, Mei visited the tree and listened to the bird's songs. She tried to

learn the words and the melody, but they were so complex that she could never quite grasp
them.

One day, as she was sitting beneath the tree, Mei had an idea. She pulled out a small
notebook and began to write down the notes and the lyrics to the bird's song. And as she

wrote, she found that the melody seemed to come alive on the page, filling her with a sense
fh
of wonder and magic. 8

And so, Mei continued to visit the tree, writing down the bird's songs and filling her
notebook with the most beautiful melodies she had ever heard. And soon, the villagers

began to gather around her, eager to hear her play and sing the songs she had learned.

Mei had discovered a gift, and she shared it with the world, bringing joy and happiness to ail
who heard her music. And she knew that she owed it all to the little bird with the golden

feathers, who had shown her the way to unlock the magic of music."

(FROM SHAKESPEARE.)

LONG time ago, when the island of Great

Britain was not so large and prosperous a
country as now, but was a wild and thinly set-
tled island, divided into several kingdoms, there
reioned over one of these dominions an old mon-
arch called Lear. He was one of the mightiest
of the British kings, and though he had a kind
and generous heart, he was so passionate that
when one of his fits of rage possessed him, his
bravest and wisest counselors could not dissuade
him from any wild or frantie purpose which
seized him.

Lear had three children, all of them daughters,
and all very beautiful. The eldest was named
Goneril; the second, Regan; and the youngest,
Cordelia. Goneril and Regan were proud and
haughty beauties. They trod the halls of their
father’s palace as if they were alrcady queens.

@ World War I (1914--1918), the Great War, was the worst the world had seen
(World War II would prove to be even worse), killing ten million troops.

@ The war was caused by the rivalry between European powers in the early
1900s. The assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in the Balkans, on
28 June, 1914, made Austria start a war with Serbia. Russia came to Serbia's
defence. Germany declared war on Russia and her ally France on 3 August.

@ The Germans had a secret plan (the ‘Schlieffen plan’) for invading France.
Instead of tackling the French head-on, as expected, they swept round to
the north through neutral Belgium. This outrage drew Britain into the war.

A long time ago, there was lived a boy named Rodney in a
village. He was very happy with his family. But his happiness
could not last for long. Rodney and his fellow villagers faced a
severe drought. They desperately waited for rains but with no
luck. All the crops, land and even trees dried up. The cattle
started dying. As there was no rain, the stream was drying up
slowly.

One night, during a meet with the villagers, Rodney said,
“Friends, we all have heard tales from our grandparents about
an underground river flowing through our village. Why don't
we dig and see?” The villagers agreed and started digging.
They dug for some days but gave up soon. However, Rodney
kept on digging. When people told him to give up, he said,
“God is helping and guiding my way.”

One day, when he had dug deep enough, Rodney saw water.
His attitude of not giving up saved the whole village. “Never
giveupso easily,” Rodney advised all the villagers. Now, they
are never short of water. And whenever any problem arises, all
the villagers came up together and find a solution."

The circus arrives without warning.

No announcements precede it, no paper notices
on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or
advertisements in local newspapers. It is simply there,
when yesterday it was not.

The towering tents are striped in white and black,
no golds and crimsons to be seen. No color at all,
save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the
surrounding fields. Black-and-white stripes on grey
sky; countless tents of varying shapes and sizes, with
an elaborate wrought-iron fence encasing them in
acolorless world. Even what little ground is visible
from outside is black or white, painted or powdered,
or treated with some other circus trick.

But it is not open for business. Not just yet.

Within hours everyone in town has heard about
it. By afternoon the news has spread several towns
over. Word of mouth is a more effective method of
advertisement than typeset words and exclamation
points on paper pamphlets or posters. It is impressive
and unusual news, the sudden appearance of a mys-
terious circus. People marvel at the staggering height
of the tallest tents. They stare at the clock that sits

just inside the gates that no one can properly describe."

“One day, however, the quiet was disturbed by a litce
drama which convulsed the calm buc busy spot.

“Mother Etienne had given to a Cochin-China hen,
which she had christened Yollande, some white duck’s eggs
to sit on. The batch of fifteen eggs had all come out. It was
really wonderful to see these fifteen baby ducks, yellow as
canaries, beaks and webbed feer pink, swarming around the
big patient sitting mother, ducking under her wings, to
come out presently and clamber helter-skelter onto her
broad back. As often happens with nurses, Yollande loved
the ducklings as her own children, and without worrying
about their shape or plumage, so different from her own, she

showered upon them proofs of the tenderest affection. Did a

the dove quickly plucked off a leaf and dropped it into
the water near the struggling ant The ant moved to-
wards the leaf and climbed up there Soon it cared
her sately to dry ground Jus! at that time, @ hunter
Nearby was throwing cut his net towards the dove,
hoping to trap it

Guessing what he was about to do, the ant quickly
bit him on the heel Feeling the pain. the hunter
dropped his net The dove was qu:ck to fly away :o
safety.

One day, there was a tortoise that lived alone in the field. F .-y day

as the other animals. He could only walk. The tort.""- thought and

Then the tortoise crawled out of its shell. He + .n and shouted, “Look
at me! | can run fast now!"" He was excite. -

The tortoise was still running along ».e path when he ran into a
large dog. The tortoise got a frigh’ . 'e stopped, turned around, and
ran away as fast as his legs cm carry him. He thought the dog
was going to chase him. And .'1e dog ran after him and barked.
“Woof-woof-woof!"" The t. + sise turned off the path and hid behind
a large rock. The dog i 1n on. When the dog was gone, the tortoise
came out from behir. ' tne rock and started running again. Not long
after, the tortoir>: «+s a noise. He looks up and sees a large bird.
The big bird wa. ted to eat the tortoise. The tortoise ran as fast as it

into the : ole. The tortoise waited until the bird flew away, then
came « « of the hole. The tortoise was unhappy because it was
scared.

He no longer has a shell in which to hide. Shortly after, it started to
rain. The tortoise was unhappy because he was soaking wet and
trembled from the cold. He did not like it.

He crawled back into his strong shell. “| do not care if | can not run
fast. | am a tortoise. | am happy to be me! "" And that is why
tortoises do not crawl out of their shells to this day.

Once a crow looked at a swan and thought how
beautiful the swan is. She had all white feathers
whereas the crow was black.

The crow expressed his thoughts to the swan. The
swan replied that according to her, the parrot is the
most beautiful bird as it has two colours and the
swan had just one.

Next, the crow approached the parrot, who simply
said that peacock is the most beautiful than him, as
it is multicolored.

When the crow expressed his thoughts to the
peacock, the peacock replied, “My dear crow, you
are the luckiest bird on this planet as you are never
caged” .""Because of my beauty, | am trapped in this
cage and you are free”.

On hearing this, the crow thought how foolish he
had been and thanked god for making him the way
he was.
Moral of the story:-
Never compare yourself to others. Be happy in what
you are and what you have.

img9.jpg,"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the mountains, there lived a young girl
named Mei. Mei was known throughout the village for her kind heart and her love of

adventure. She spent her days exploring the forests and meadows around her home, always
eager to discover something new.

One day, as she was wandering through the woods, Mei came across a beautiful butterfly. Its
wings were a bright shade of blue, and it fluttered about het head as if trying to get her

attention. Mei followed the butterfly deeper into the forest, until she came to a clearing that
she had never seen before.

In the center of the clearing stood a tall, majestic tree, its branches stretching up towards

the sky. And there, perched in the branches, was a tiny bird with feathers as golden as the
sun.

Mei felt a sudden surge of curiosity and wonder, and she climbed up the tree to get a closer

look. As she approached the bird. it chirped a sweet melody that filled her heart with joy.

“Hello, little one,” Mei whispered. ""What brings you to this tree?”

The bird looked at Mei with its bright, beady eyes and sang a song that seemed to hold a

secret. Mei listened intently, trying to understand the meaning behind the melody.

As the sun began to set, Mei climbed down from the tree and made her way back to the

village. She couldn't stop thinking about the bird and its beautiful song, and she knew that
she had to return to the tree the next day."
