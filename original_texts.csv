The pond was unlike any she had ever seen before. Its waters were crystal clear and sparkled in the sunlight. The banks were lined with vibrant wildflowers and ancient trees that seemed to reach up to the sky. Lily felt a sense of wonder and awe wash over her, and she knew that this was a special place.
As she gazed into the pond, Lily noticed a small fish swimming lazily in the water. The fish was a brilliant shade of blue, and its scales shimmered in the light. Lily reached out to touch the fish, but it darted away just out of her reach
Determined to catch the fish. Lily spent hours sitting by the pond, trying to lure it with bits of bread and insects. Eventually, the fish grew used to her presence and swam closer and closer until Lily was finally able to scoop it up in her hands.
As she held the fish in her palms, Lily felt a sudden surge of energy flow through her body. She could sense that this fish was no ordinary creature, but something magical and mystical With a sense of excitement and trepidation, Lily decided to take the fish home and care for it.

As time went on, Lily began to notice changes within herself. She felt more confident and bold, and her sense of wonder and curiosity continued to grow. She knew that the fish had given her a gift, one that she would cherish for the rest of her life.
Years passed, and Lily grew into a wise and kind woman. She continued to visit the pond and the fish, and each time she did, she felt a sense of peace and contentment wash over her.
She knew that she had discovered something truly special, something that had changed her life forever.

A long time ago, there was lived a boy named Rodney in a village. He was very happy with his family. But his happiness could not last for long. Rodney and his fellow villagers faced a severe drought. They desperately waited for rains but with no luck. All the crops, land and even trees dried up. The cattle started dying. As there was no rain, the stream was drying up slowly.

One night, during a meet with the villagers, Rodney said, ""Friends, we all have heard tales from our grandparents about an underground river flowing through our village. Why don't we dig and see?"" The villagers agreed and started digging. They dug for some days but gave up soon. However, Rodney kept on digging. When people told him to give up, he said, ""God is helping and guiding my way.""

One day, when he had dug deep enough, Rodney saw water. His attitude of not giving up saved the whole village. ""Never give up so easily,"" Rodney advised all the villagers. Now, they are never short of water. And whenever any problem arises, all the villagers came up together and find a solution."
img4.jpg,"The Ant and the Dove

One hot day, an ant was searching for some water. After walking around for some time, she came to a spring. To reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass. While making her way up, she slipped and fell into the water.

She could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree had not seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly plucked off a leaf and dropped it into the water near the struggling ant. The ant moved to- wards the leaf and climbed up there. Soon it carried her safely to dry ground. Just at that time, a hunter nearby was throwing out his net towards the dove, hoping to trap it.

Guessing what he was about to do, the ant quickly bit him on the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped his net. The dove was quick to fly away to safety.

One good turn deserves another."
img5.jpg,"Tortoise and his shell
One day, there was a tortoise that lived alone in the field. Every day he watched the other animals run fast, and he felt sad because he was so slow. The tortoise was sad because he could not run as fast as the other animals. He could only walk. The tortoise thought and thought, and then he said, ""I cannot run fast because my shell is too heavy. If I could crawl out of my shell, I would be able to run fast."" Then the tortoise crawled out of its shell. He ran and shouted, ""Look at me! I can run fast now!"" He was excited.
The tortoise was still running along the path when he ran into a large dog. The tortoise got a fright . He stopped, turned around, and ran away as fast as his legs could carry him. He thought the dog was going to chase him. And the  dog ran after him and barked. ""Woof-woof-woof!"" The tortoise turned off the path and hid behind a large rock. The dog ran on. When the dog was gone, the tortoise came out from behind the rock and started running again. Not long after, the tortoises heard a noise. He looks up and sees a large bird. The big bird wanted, to eat the tortoise. The tortoise ran as fast as it could away from there. It saw a tree with a hole in it and quickly ran into the hole. The tortoise waited until the bird flew away, then came out of the hole. The tortoise was unhappy because it was scared.
He no longer has a shell in which to hide. Shortly after, it started to rain. The tortoise was unhappy because he was soaking wet and trembled from the cold. He did not like it. He crawled back into his strong shell. ""I do not care if can not run fast. I am a tortoise. I am happy to be me!"" And that is why tortoises do not crawl out of their shells to this day.

Ten Stories in English

Introduction

Ten folk tales are written in English at four stages/levels to use for classroom literacy exercises and/or in conjunction with Japanese Folk Tales Activity Book and Japanese Folk Tales Creative Resources

This book was written on the request of teachers who considered that obtaining the desired folk tale books at an appropriate reading level is often very difficult and expensive. Therefore, as well as the numerous resources listed in Japanese Folk Tales Activity Book, a more available and user friendly option has been provided in English. There are already sufficient junior level books/stories/websites/videos available in Japanese, as indicated in the resource list.

All the stories are written in the recount genre with well spaced paragraphs over a three to five pages to allow for class sets to be made. Teachers may use this format to encourage students to rewrite stories in the Narrative, Dialogue or Poetic genres and to encourage group oral reading and drama.

Additional literacy and story recall exercises are provided at the back of the book. These pages have application for any story and may be adapted to class or teacher needs.

Extensive supporting language and literacy exercises and activities are provided in Japanese Folk Tales Activity Book by the same author. A complementary book, Japanese Folk Tales Creative Resources by Peter Hooper has an extensive range of 2D and 3D craft and art activities based on the ten folk tales in this book."

img8.jpg,"Who is Happy?

Once a crow looked at a swan and thought how beautiful the swan is. She had all white feathers whereas the crow was black.

The crow expressed his thoughts to the swan. The swan replied that according to her, the parrot is the most beautiful bird as it has two colours and the swan had just one.

Next, the crow approached the parrot, who simply said that peacock is the most beautiful than him, as it is multicolored.

When the crow expressed his thoughts to the peacock, the peacock replied, ""My dear crow, you are the luckiest bird on this planet as you are never caged"".""Because of my beauty, I am trapped in this cage and you are free"".

On hearing this, the crow thought how foolish he had been and thanked god for making him the way

he was. Moral of the story:-

Never compare yourself to others. Be happy in what you are and what you have.

She spent her days exploring the forests and meadows around her home, always eager to discover something new.

One day, as she was wandering through the woods, Mei came across a beautiful butterfly, its wings were a bright shade of blue, and it fluttered about her head as if trying to get her attention. Mei followed the butterfly deeper into the forest, until she came to a clearing that she had never seen before.

In the center of the clearing stood a tall, majestic tree, its branches stretching up towards the sky. And there, perched in the branches, was a tiny bird with feathers as golden as the sun.

Mei felt a sudden surge of curiosity and wonder, and she climbed up the tree to get a closer look. As she approached the bird, it chirped a sweet melody that filled her heart with joy.

""Hello, little one,"" Mei whispered. ""What brings you to this tree?""

The bird looked at Mei with its bright, beady eyes and sang a song that seemed to hold a secret. Mei listened intently, trying to understand the meaning behind the melody.

As the sun began to set, Mei climbed down from the tree and made her way back to the village. She couldn't stop thinking about the bird and its beautiful song, and she knew that she had to return to the tree the next day."

As the sun began to set, Mei climbed down from the tree and made her way back to the village. She couldn't stop thinking about the bird and its beautiful song, and she knew that she had to return to the tree the next day.

For many days and nights, Mei visited the tree and listened to the bird's songs. She tried to learn the words and the melody, but they were so complex that she could never quite grasp them.

One day, as she was sitting beneath the tree, Mei had an idea. She pulled out a small notebook and began to write down the notes and the lyrics to the bird's song. And as she wrote, she found that the melody seemed to come alive on the page, filling her with a sense of wonder and magic.

And so, Mei continued to visit the tree, writing down the bird's songs and filling her

notebook with the most beautiful melodies she had ever heard. And soon, the villagers

began to gather around her, eager to hear her play and sing the songs she had learned

Mei had discovered a gift, and she shared it with the world, bringing joy and happiness to all who heard her music. And she knew that she owed it all to the little bird with the golden feathers, who had shown her the way to unlock the magic of music"

img13.jpg,"Slices of Life ( A Short Story) 
Dr. N. K.Neb* 
The visits of our city- based, rich relatives were extremely exciting for little children, young 
girls, and boys; it dampened the spirits of our elders. But it was not so when some foreign based aunt 
or uncle was to visit us. 
The aunt would visit every two years to have a feel of her native land. Earlier a letter, 
nowadays an e-mail or mobile call initiated the preparations to make her stay comfortable. Today, the 
constant flow of greetings , a sparkling glow of excitement and the words that my mother often 
repeated while talking to our N.R I. aunt , indicated the obvious. It was Aunt Jetinder, alias Jenny to 
whom my mother was talking go on the mobile phone, “ I’m your sister.... a real sister .... You 
remember how I used to carry you on my back when you got tired on our way home from school.....” 
As the prolonged conversation over the phone ended my mother took a long breath and looked around 
so that she could tell to someone that she had had a phone call from Canada. She was happy to find 
me standing beside her and started telling me “You know, your aunt Jenny…. I mean … Jeeto …. Is 
coming to India the next week….. I have been told that she would land at Delhi early morning on 
Monday. … We should start collecting the things she likes….. keep the house tidy…. I have already 
asked your wife to wash the table cloth …. change the dirty oil stained bed sheets with the new ones 
we bought on Dipawali…. We’ll borrow the crockery from our neighbourer Mrs. Sandhu…… There 
should be no hesitation in asking her ….. When her sister in law visited her last month, didn’t she 
take a number of things from us to please her . .. . Even Kesro has offered to lend her silver utensils 
for the purpose….. I’m not going to let her come near Jenny when she comes…. Don’t you know how 
she tried to secretly persuade her to get her nephew married to Kesro’ daughter….. She otherwise 
looks down upon us for being of lower origin …. When it comes to going abroad, she is ready to do 
anything …. Anything…. Including wipe the adult soiled diapers of your Uncle. No…. we are not to 
trust her. … I’ll look after these things myself. … You only arrange leave for a few days to take your 
aunt around and accompany her to the Golden Temple as and when she asks. 
I had seen these things repeated since Aunt Jenny’s visits to India had increased for the last 
three years. She was trying to get her son Garry, earlier Gurinder, married to an Indian educated, and 
wealthy Indian girl from her own community and caste. A few months back her son too had visited 
us. 
He had different views regarding marriage. He told me that he no longer believed that the girl 
should belong to some high caste or not. During our conversation on this issue, he revealed his 
intentions. He told me, “Dear brother, Mom meri problem understand nahin karde ! (Mother does not 
understand my problem.)… Jaat … paat is nothing! (Caste has no significance) ….. One has to live 
in comfort or keep on arranging for others’ education …. Training or diplomas and courses of 
study…. It’s simply foolish….” After a brief pause, my inquisitive looks prompted him to elaborate, 
“What am I to do with the degrees and qualifications or name or fame of her family …. Am I to paste 
them on my face…? … The looks also don’t matter much…., “When he said this, he discretely added, 
“There are many to serve that purpose…. Only they are not ready to make a family and look after the 
children…”On hearing this I pointed out, “It means, you are no longer interested in the girl my friend 
has suggested ….. She is an M.A. in English and doing PhD…. She is beautiful and her father owns 
twenty acres of land.” He looked at me like an irritated teacher who looks at a dull student unable to 
understand a simple sum and said, “Dear brother… brother dear ….. You know if I marry this girl ….. 
This rich and beautiful girl….. I’ll have to spend for her education and upkeep for at least three more 
years and only then she will perhaps be able to get a good job…. Isn’t it better for me to marry a 
qualified nurse who is going to get a job right on entering Canada? …… Try to understand…. Why 
waste our hard earned dollars on useless things and not do something logical”. 
The boy’s wish had been granted and his marriage with a girl half his height was fixed. Aunt 
Jenny was coming a month earlier to make necessary arrangements to solemnize the marriage. 
Before her arrival we worked overtime to give our house a new look. Whenever she came to 
India she preferred to stay with us and avoided staying in a hotel or with the family of her brother-in-"

img16.jpg,"The Whale

There are between 79 and 84 different species of whale known to man. They are found in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and never meet or breed together. Their migration is timed so that they are never in breeding areas at the same time.

Whales are large, intelligent animals. They feed on small marine life called krill.

The Blue Whale is the largest animal on Earth; it is larger than any of the dinosaurs! A single adult Blue Whale can eat 36,000kg of krill per day. They catch their food mainly by diving and can descend to depths of approximately 500 meters (1640 feet). Its heart is as big as a car, and its tongue can weigh as much as an elephant.

While fish swim by moving their tails from left to right, whales swim

by moving their tails up and down."

(FROM SHAKKAPKARE)

ALONG time ago, when the island of Great Britain was not so large and prosperous a country as now, but was a wild and thinly set- tled island, divided into several kingdoms, there reigned over one of these dominions an old mon- arch called Lear. He was one of the mightiest of the British kings, and though he had a kind and generous heart, he was so passionate that when one of his fits of rage possessed him, his bravest and wisest counselors could not dissuade him from any wild or frantic purpose which seized him.

Lear had three children, all of them daughters, and all very beautiful. The oldest was named Goneril; the second, Regan; and the youngest, Cordelia. Goneril and Regan were proud and haughty beauties. They trod the halls of their father's palace as if they were already queens. When any story of suffering or complaint of wrong arose from the people, they always took"

Lions live in savannas, grasslands, bushes and woodlands. They are the most social of all the big cats, and are the only cats to live in family groups called prides in a pride, lions hunt prey, raise cubs and defend their territory together. Hunting is generally done in the dark by the lionesses

They have very few sweat glands so they will rest during the day and become active at night when it is cooler. They enjoy relaxing and can spend between sixteen and twenty hours each day resting and sleeping

When the lionesses have a successful hunt the males will eat first, followed by the females and then the cubs the main job of the male is defending the prides territory. A male's loud roar, usually heard after sunset, con carry as for as 8 kilometers (5 miles). They roar to communicate their position to other prides. The older the male lion becomes, the darker his mane will become

A lion will run from many creatures, including elephants they can run for short distances of 80 kilometers per hour (50mph) and leap

as far as 11 meters (36 feet)"

img23.jpg,"The gods of Egypt

The mighty sun god, Ra-Atum, was called many different names by ancient Egyptians.

The sun god was sometimes pictured as a scarab beetle. This is because a scarab beetle rolls a ball of dung before it, as the ball of the sun rolls

across the sky.

Myths say that the sun god

has a secret name, known only to himself, which was the key to all his power.

The blue scarab beetle Khephri is one of the many forms of the sun god. This amulet was made over 3000 years ago.

⚫ The ancient Egyptians believed that part of the spirit of a god could live on Earth in the body of an animal. This is why their gods are pictured as humans with animal heads.

Hathor or Sekhmet was the daughter and wife of Ra-Atum. She could take on the form of a terrifying lioness or cobra to attack and punish enemies of the sun god.

Osiris was the son of Ra-Atum. He became king of Egypt and later, ruler of

the underworld Kingdom of the Dead.

Osiris's brother, Seth, represented evil in the universe. He hatched a

wicked plot to murder Osiris and take the crown of Egypt for himself."

In 1774, the Turkish Ottoman Empire was defeated by the Russians after a six-year war, and was forced to allow Russian ships to pass through the Straits from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.

During the 1800s, the Ottoman Empire grew weaker and weaker and was called 'the Sick Man of Europe' by foreign statesmen.

In 1829, the Greeks fought a successful war of independence against the Turks. Other Balkan states followed suit.

During the 1800s, the Turks fought four wars

against Russia and lost three. Russia gained

Bessarabia (now Moldova and

Ukraine) and control of the

Black Sea.

Trying to stop the empire's decline, Sultan Abdul-Hamid Il crushed opposition violently in the 1890s.

World War I (1914-1918), the Great War, was the worst the world had seen

(World War II would prove to be even worse), killing ten million troops. The war was caused by the rivalry between European powers in the early 1900s. The assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in the Balkans, on 28 June, 1914, made Austria start a war with Serbia. Russia came to Serbia's

defence. Germany declared war on Russia and her ally France on 3 August. The Germans had a secret plan (the 'Schlieffen plan') for invading France. Instead of tackling the French head-on, as expected, they swept round to the north through neutral Belgium. This outrage drew Britain into the war."

contain my curiosity. ""Actually, it was the easiest thing I have ever done. The decision to give up my practice and all my worldly posses- sions felt natural.

The circus arrives without warning.

No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.

The towering tents are striped in white and black, no golds and crimsons to be seen. No color at all, save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the surrounding fields. Black-and-white stripes on grey sky; countless tents of varying shapes and sizes, with an elaborate wrought-iron fence encasing them in a colorless world. Even what little ground is visible from outside is black or white, painted or powdered, or treated with some other circus trick.

But it is not open for business. Not just yet. Within hours everyone in town has heard about it. By afternoon the news has spread several towns over. Word of mouth is a more effective method of advertisement than typeset words and exclamation points on paper pamphlets or posters. It is impressive and unusual news, the sudden appearance of a mys- terious circus. People marvel at the staggering height of the tallest tents. They stare at the clock that sits just inside the gates that no one can properly describe."

EVERY OBJECT in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.

When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view. The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.

At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of the which whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other. Mrs Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw instantly that her cousin's manners were not altered by his marriage; his formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife's offers of refreshment.

Marianne answers the door when Connell rings the bell. She's still wearing her school uniform, but she's taken off the sweater, so it's just the blouse and skirt, and she has no shoes on, only tights.

Oh, hey, he says. Come on in.

She turns and walks down the hall. He follows her, closing the door behind him. Down a few steps in the kitchen, his mother Lorraine is peeling off a pair of rubber gloves. Mari- anne hops onto the countertop and picks up an open jar of chocolate spread, in which she has left a teaspoon.

Marianne was telling me you got your mock results today,

Lorraine says.

We got English back, he says. They come back separately. Do you want to head on? Lorraine folds the rubber gloves up neatly and replaces

them below the sink. Then she starts unclipping her hair. To

""One day, however, the quiet was disturbed by a little drama which convulsed the calm but busy spot.

""Mother Etienne had given to a Cochin-China hen, which she had christened Yollande, some white duck's eggs to sit on. The batch of fifteen eggs had all come out. It was really wonderful to see these fifteen baby ducks, yellow as canaries, beaks and webbed feet pink, swarming around the big patient sitting mother, ducking under her wings, to come out presently and clamber helter-skelter onto her broad back. As often happens with nurses, Yollande loved the ducklings as her own children, and without worrying about their shape or plumage, so different from her own, she showered upon them proofs of the tenderest affection. Did a fly pass within their reach, all these little ones jumped at it,"

img35.jpg," The dodo (Raphus cucullatus) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Mauritius, which is east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The dodo's closest genetic relative was the also-extinct Rodrigues solitaire. The two formed the subfamily Raphinae, a clade of extinct flightless birds that were a part of the family which includes pigeons and doves. The closest living relative of the dodo is the Nicobar pigeon. A white dodo was once thought to have existed on the nearby island of Reunion, but it is now believed that this assumption was merely confusion based on the also-extinct Reunion ibis and paintings of white dodos

Subfossil remains show the dodo was about 1 metre (3 ft 3 in) tall and may have weighed 10.6-17.5 kg (23- 39 lb) in the wild. The dodo's appearance in life is evidenced only by drawings, paintings, and written accounts from the 17th century. Since these portraits vary considerably, and since only some of the illustrations are known to have been drawn from live specimens, the dodos' exact appearance in life remains unresolved, and little is known about its behaviour. It has been depicted with brownish-grey plumage, yellow feet, a tuft of tail feathers, a grey, naked head, and a black, yellow, and green beak. It used gizzard stones to help digest its food, which is thought to have included fruits, and its main habitat is believed to have been the woods in the drier coastal areas of Mauritius. One account states its clutch consisted of a single egg. It is presumed that the dodo became flightless because of the ready availability of abundant food sources and a relative absence of predators on Mauritius. Though the dodo has historically been portrayed as being fat and clumsy, it is now thought to have been well-adapted for its ecosystem.

The first recorded mention of the dodo was by Dutch sailors in 1598. In the following years, the bird was hunted by sailors and invasive species, while its habitat was being destroyed. The last widely accepted sighting of a dodo was in 1662 Its extinction was not immediately noticed, and some considered it to be a myth. In the 19th century, research was conducted on a small quantity of remains of four specimens that had been brought to Europe in the early 17th century. Among these is a dried head, the only soft tissue of the dodo that remains today. Since then, a large amount of subfossil material has been collected on Mauritius, mostly from the Mare aux Songes swamp. The extinction of the dodo within less than a century of its discovery called attention to the previously unrecognised problem of human involvement in the disappearance of entire species. The dodo achieved widespread recognition from its role in the story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and it has since become a fixture in popular culture, often as a symbol of extinction and obsolescence."

img43.jpg," The House of the Seven Gables

by Nathaniel Hawthorne

Halfway down a by-street of one of our New England towns stands a rusty wooden house, with seven acutely peaked gables, facing towards various points of the compass, and a huge, clustered chimney in the midst. The street is Pyncheon Street, the house is the old Pyn- cheon House; and an elm-tree, of wide circumference, rooted before the door, is familiar to every town-born child by the title of the Pyncheon Elm.

On my occasional visits to the town aforesaid, I seldom failed to turn down Pyncheon Street, for the sake of passing through the shadow of these two antiquities, the great elm-tree and the weath- er-beaten edince.

The aspect of the venerable mansion has always affected me like a human countenance, bearing the traces not merely of outward storm and sunshine, but expressive also, of the long lapse of mortal life, and

accompanying vicissitudes that have passed within. Were these to be worthily recounted, they would form a narrative of no small interest and instruc- tion, and possessing, moreover, a certain remarkable unity, which might almost seem the result of artistic arrangement.

One day, while Ava was out walking in the woods, she came across a small, injured bird. She carefully picked up the bird and took it back to her cottage, where she nursed it back to health

The bird, whose name was Feather, was grateful to Ava for saving its life. As a reward, Feather gave Ava a magical feather that could grant her three wishes. Ava was overjoyed and grateful, but she didn't want to waste her wishes on something frivolous.

Instead, she decided to use her first wish to help the people in her village. She wished for an endless supply of food and water, so that no one in the village would ever go hungry or thirsty again.

The wish was granted, and soon the village was overflowing with fresh fruits and vegetables. clean water, and even an abundance of fish in the nearby river. The people the village were amazed and grateful, and they all praised Ava for her selfless wish.

For her second wish, Ava decided to use the feather to help her parents. They had been struggling to make ends meet on their small farm, and Ava wanted to ease their burden. She wished for her parents' farm to flourish, and for their crops and animals to grow strong and healthy."
img50.jpg,"Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in the heart of a lush forest, there lived a young girl named Lily, Lily was a bright and curious girl, who loved exploring the woods and discovering new things. She was always eager to learn more about the world around her and was never afraid to ask questions

One day, as she was wandering through the forest, Lily stumbled upon a strange clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a magnificent tree, taller and wider than any she had ever seen its trunk was thick and gnarled and its branches spread out like the fingers of a giant hand, reaching towards the sky

As Lily approached the tree, she noticed something odd. There was a small door at the base of the trunk, just big enough for her to squeeze through Without hesitation, she pushed open the door and stepped inside.

To her surprise, she found herself in a magical room, filled with books and ancient artifacts. There were maps and charts, crystal balls and potions, and all sorts of curious objects that she had never seen before. As she wandered through the room, she came across a small book, bound in leather and adorned with golden letters.

Curious. Lily picked up the book and began to read. As she did, she was transported to a far-

off land, filled with wonder and adventure. She met dragons and wizards, fairies and giants,

and traveled through deserts and mountains, forests and oceans."
img51.png,"In batch learning, the system is incapable of learning incrementally: it must be trained

using all the available data. This will generally take a lot of time and computing resources, so it is typically done offline. First the system is trained, and then it is launched into production and runs without learning anymore; it just applies what it has learned. This is called offline learning. If you want a batch learning system to know about new data (such as a new type of

spam), you need to train a new version of the system from scratch on the full dataset

(not just the new data, but also the old data), then stop the old system and replace it

with the new one.

Fortunately, the whole process of training, evaluating, and launching a Machine Learning system can be automated fairly easily (as shown in Figure 1-3), so even a batch learning system can adapt to change. Simply update the data and train a new version of the system from scratch as often as needed.

This solution is simple and often works fine, but training using the full set of data can

take many hours, so you would typically train a new system only every 24 hours or

even just weekly. If your system needs to adapt to rapidly changing data (eg, to pre-

dict stock prices), then you need a more reactive solution.

Also, training on the full set of data requires a lot of computing resources (CPL

memory space, disk space, disk I/O, network I/O, etc). If you have a lot of data and

you automate your system to train from scratch every day it will end up costing you a

lot of money. If the amount of data is huge, it may even be impossible to use a batch

learning algorithm

Finally, if your system needs to be able to learn autonomously and it has limited reces (eg, a smartphone application a rover on Mars), then carrying large amounts of training deta and taking lot of moutes to trainer hours every day is a showstopper."
img52.png,"This is what a typical Machine Learning project looks like. In Chapter 2 you will experience this firsthand by going through a project end to end.

We have covered a lot of ground so far: you now know what Machine Learning is really about, why it is useful, what some of the most common categories of ML. sys- tems are, and what a typical project workflow looks like. Now let's look at what can go

wrong in learning and prevent you from making accurate predictions

Main Challenges of Machine Learning

In short, since your main task is to select a learning algorithm and train it on some data, the two things that can go wrong are ""bad algorithm"" and ""bad data"" Let's start with examples of bad data.

Insufficient Quantity of Training Data

For a toddler to learn what an apple is all it takes is for you to point to an apple and say ""apple (possibly repeating this procedure few times). Now the child is able to recognize apples in all sorts of colors and shapes. Genius.

Machine Learning is not quite there yet, it takes a lot of data for most Machine Learn-ing algorithms to work properly Even for very simple problems you typically need
thousands of examples, and for complex problems such as image or speech recogni-tion you may need millions of examples (unless you can reuse parts of an existing model)."
img53.png,"Perhaps the most famous example of sampling bias happened during the US presi dential election in 1936, which pitted Landon against Roosevelt the Literary Digest conducted a very large poll, sending mail to about 10 million people. It got 2.4 million answers, and predicted with high confidence that Landon would get 57% of the votes Instead, Roosevelt won with 62% of the votes. The flaw was in the Literary Digest's sampling method:

First, to obtain the addresses to send the polls to, the Literary Digest used tele

phone directories, lists of magazine subscribers, club membership lists, and the

like. All of these lists tended to favor wealthier people, who were more likely to

vote Republican (hence Landon). Second, less than 25% of the people who were polled answered. Again this intro- duced a sampling bias, by potentially ruling out people who didn't care much about politics, people who didn't like the Literary Digest, and other key groups This is a special type of sampling bias called nonresponse bias

Here is another example: say you want to build a system to recognize funk music vid

eos. One way to build your training set is to search for ""funk music"" on You Tube and

use the resulting videos. But this assumes that YouTube's search engine returns a set of

videos that are representative of all the funk music videos on YouTube. In reality, the

search results are likely to be biased toward popular artists (and if you live in Brazil

you will get a lot of ""funk carioca videos, which sound nothing like James Brown)

On the other hand, how else can you get a large training set?

Poor-Quality Data

Obviously, if your training data is full of errors, outliers, and noise (eg, due to poor- quality measurements), it will make it harder for the system to detect the underlying patterns, so your system is less likely to perform well. It is often well worth the effort so spend time cleaning up your training data. The truth is, most data scientists spend significant part of their time doing just that. The following are a couple of examples and wand to clean up training data."
img54.png,"This is often tackled using Reinforcement Learning (RL; see Chapter 18), which is a branch of Machine Learning that trains agents (such as bots) to pick the actions that will maximize their rewards over time (e.g., a bot may get a reward every time the player loses some life points), within a given environment (such as the game). The famous AlphaGo program that beat the world champion at the game of Go was built using RL.

This list could go on and on, but hopefully it gives you a sense of the incredible breadth and complexity of the tasks that Machine Learning can tackle, and the types of techniques that you would use for each task.

Types of Machine Learning Systems

There are so many different types of Machine Learning systems that it is useful to

classify them in broad categories, based on the following criteria:

. Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsuper- vised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning)

Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning)

Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points or instead by detecting patterns in the training data and building a predictive

model, much like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)

These criteria are not exclusive, you can combine them in any way you like. For example, a state-of-the-art spam filter may learn on the fly using a deep neural net- work model trained using examples of spam and ham, this makes it an online, model- based, supervised learning system. Let's look at each of these criteria a bit more closely

Supervised/Unsupervised Learning

Machine Learning systems can be classified according to the amount and type of supervalos they get during training. There are four major categories, superint learning, unsupervised learning, serntsupervised learning and Reinforcement Learning."
img55.png,"Inspired by real-life examples of common distributions"", I wonder what pedagogical examples people use to demonstrate negative

skewness? There are many ""canonical examples of symmetric or normal distributions used in teaching-even if ones like height and weight don't survive closer biological scrutiny! Blood pressure might be nearer normality. I like astronomical measurement errors-of historic interest, they are intuitively no more likely to lie in one direction than another, with small errors more likely than large

Common pedagogical examples for positive skewness include people's incomes; mileage on used cars for sale; reaction times in a psychology experiment; house prices; number of accident claims by an insurance customer; number of children in a family. Their physical reasonableness often stems from being bounded below (usually by zero), with low values being plausible, even common, yet very large (sometimes orders of magnitude higher) values are well-known to occur.

For negative skew, I find it harder to give unambiguous and vivid examples that a younger audience (high schoolers) can intuitively grasp, perhaps because fewer real-life distributions have a clear upper bound. A bad-taste example I was taught at school was ""number of fingers"" Most folk have ten, but some lose one or more in accidents. The upshot was ""99% of people have a higher-than-average number of fingers""! Polydactyly complicates the issue, as ten is not a strict upper bound; since both missing and extra fingers are rare events, it may be unclear to students which effect predominates

I usually use a binomial distribution with high p. But students often find ""number of satisfactory components in a batch is negatively skewed less intuitive than the complementary fact that ""number of faulty components in a batch is positively skewed"". (The textbook is industrially themed: I prefer cracked and intact eggs in a box of twelve ) Maybe students feel that ""success"" should be rare.

Another option is to point out that if X is positively skewed then-X is negatively skewed, but to place this in a practical context (negative house prices are negatively skewed"") seems doomed to pedagogical failure. While there are benefits to teaching the effects of data transformations, it seems wise to give a concrete example first. I would prefer one that does not seem artificial, where the negative skew is quite unambiguous, and for which students' life-experience should give them an awareness of the shape of the distribution."
img56.png,"When most people hear ""Machine Learning,"" they picture a robot: a dependable but ler or a deadly Terminator, depending on who you ask. But Machine Learning is not just a futuristic fantasy; it's already here. In fact, it has been around for decades in some specialized applications, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR). But the first ML. application that really became mainstream, improving the lives of hundreds of millions of people, took over the world back in the 1990s: the spam filter. It's not exactly a self-aware Skynet, but it does technically qualify as Machine Learning (it has actually learned so well that you seldom need to flag an email as spam anymore). It was followed by hundreds of ML. applications that now quietly power hundreds of products and features that you use regularly, from better recommendations to voice search

Where does Machine Learning start and where does it end? What exactly does it mean for a machine to learn something? If I download a copy of Wikipedia, has my computer really learned something Is it suddenly smarter? In this chapter we will start by clarifying what Machine Learning is and why you may want to use it. Then, before we set out to explore the Machine Learning continent, we will take a look at the map and learn about the main regons and the most notable landmarks

img58.png,"No Free Lunch Theorem

A model is a simplified version of the observations. The simplifications are meant to discard the superfluous details that are unlikely to generalize to new instances. To decide what data to discard and what data to keep, you must make assumptions. For example, a linear model makes the assumption that the data is fundamentally linear and that the distance between the instances and the straight line is just noise, which can safely be ignored.

In a famous 1996 paper,"" David Wolpert demonstrated that if you make absolutely no assumption about the data, then there is no reason to prefer one model over any other. This is called the No Free Lunch (NFL) theorem. For some datasets the best model is a linear model, while for other datasets it is a neural network. There is no model that is a priori guaranteed to work better (hence the name of the theorem). The only way to know for sure which model is best is to evaluate them all. Since this is not possible, in practice you make some reasonable assumptions about the data and eval- uate only a few reasonable models. For example, for simple tasks you may evaluate linear models with various levels of regularization, and for a complex problem you may evaluate various neural networks.

Exercises

In this chapter we have covered some of the most important concepts in Machine Learning In the next chapters we will dive deeper and write more code, but before we do, make sure you know how to answer the following questions:

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines? 3. What is a labeled training set?

4. What are the two most common supervised tasks!

img59.png,"Pipelines

A sequence of data processing components is called a data pipeline. Pipelines are ver common in Machine Learning systems, since there is a lot of data to manipulate and many data transformations to apply.

Components typically run asynchronously. Each component pulls in a large amount of data, processes it, and spits out the result in another data store. Then, some time later, the next component in the pipeline pulls this data and spits out its own output. Each component is fairly self-contained: the interface between components is simply the data store. This makes the system simple to grasp (with the help of a data flow graph), and different teams can focus on different components. Moreover, if a com- ponent breaks down, the downstream components can often continue to run nor- mally (at least for a while) by just using the last output from the broken component. This makes the architecture quite robust.

On the other hand, a broken component can go unnoticed for some time if proper monitoring is not implemented. The data gets stale and the overall system's perfor mance drops. The next question to ask your boss is what the current solution looks like (if any)

The current situation will often give you a reference for performance, as well as

inughts on how to solve the problem. Your boss answers that the district housing pri-

ces are currently estimated manually by experts: a team gathers up-to-date informa-

tion about a district, and when they cannot get the median housing price, they

estimate it using complex rules

This is costly and time-consuming, and their estimates are not great; in cases where

they manage to find out the actual median housing price, they often realize that their

estimates were off by more than 20%. This is why the company thinks that it would

be useful to train a model to predicts districts median housing price, given other"
